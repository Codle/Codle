### Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to Codle's repo. Please feel free to submit issues with me for any questions.

- I'm an engineer of AML (Applied Machine Learning) at ByteDance
- I'm interested in machine learning competitions such as the Tianchi, Kaggle.
- I wanna be a "real" full-stack engineer, who not only knows about frontend or backend but also machine learning, real-time systems, and distributed systems, etc.
